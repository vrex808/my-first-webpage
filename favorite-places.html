    <h1> These are my favorite places to visit when back home in Hawaii </h1>

    <p> I was born in Honolulu, HI but have grown up in Redmond, WA pretty much my whole life. 
        I would go back home each Summer and stay there all Summer long. 
        The Diamond Head would have to be one of my favorite hikes on the island.

      <h2> Waianae is on the beautiful Westside of the island </h2>

      <p> Westside of Oahu brings us to Waianae. 
          I'd say it's more of a laid back, less busy destination where I like to enjoy my time.
          There are a few great local food spots and snack spots to get my favorit dish, Laulau, and my favorite treat, malosadas.
